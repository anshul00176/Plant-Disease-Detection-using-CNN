#  Plant Disease Detection System using CNN 
This project is a deep learning-based image classification system designed to detect 38 types of plant diseases from leaf images. It includes the complete pipeline — from data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation, to a deployed Flask web application that enables real-time disease prediction from uploaded images.

#  Dataset
This project uses a publicly available dataset of plant disease images, commonly referred to as PlantVillage. It may also include an augmented dataset for improved generalization.

#  Model Training

The model was trained using Keras's ImageDataGenerator for on-the-fly image augmentation.

Optimizer: Adam, Loss Function: categorical_crossentropy

Metrics: Accuracy

Epochs: 25–50 (tunable)

Achieved > 95% validation accuracy after training.
